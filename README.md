# CNN-Model-Training-on-MNIST-Dataset
This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, and the goal of the model is to accurately classify these digits.
